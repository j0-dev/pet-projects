script spread idea:
    - run a script(3) that connects to every server up to current hacking level, running all port openers
    - utilise max threads on given server to run a script(1) that endlessly grows/weakens the server it's copied onto (copy on to all)  (OR ON HOME?? )
    - run a script(2) that hacks all servers 1 by 1 up to the server <= current hacking level, like a sweep
    - (check each server is @ 100% of growth before hacking)
    - repeat pass endlessly, +1 in sever list when hack level reaches hack level of next server
